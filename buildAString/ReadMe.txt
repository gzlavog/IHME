Keywords:
Suffix Array
Kasai algorithm to build LCP(longest common prefix) array
Graphs
Dijkstra algorithm

The problem statement can be found at: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/build-a-string/problem

Please note that the code does not read input files. The code expects input from console. 

The code for building of the suffix array does not belong to me. I have used online sources.
I have been using Dijkstra with various occasions, for example in acoustic treatment optimizations.
