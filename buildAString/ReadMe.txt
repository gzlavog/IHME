suffix array
Kasai algorithm to build LCP(longest common prefix) array
Graphs
Dijkstra algorithm

Please note that the code does not read input files. The code expects input from console. 
The code for building of the suffix array does not belong to me. I have used online sources.
Similarly, starting with online source, I have adapted the Kasai algorithm to suit my needs.
I have been using Dijkstra with various occasions, for example in acoustic treatment optimizations.
